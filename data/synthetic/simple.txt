Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data. Natural language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand human language. Computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world.
