Python basics for beginners:
To print "Hello, World!" use: print("Hello, World!")
Variables store values. Example: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to variable x.
Strings are text enclosed in quotes. Example: name = "Alice"
Numbers can be integers (5) or floats (3.14).
Booleans are True or False values.

Control flow:
Use if statements for decisions: if age >= 18: print("Adult")
else handles alternative cases: else: print("Minor")
elif adds more conditions: elif age < 13: print("Child")
Use for loops to iterate: for i in range(5): print(i)
Use while loops to repeat until condition: while count < 10: count += 1

Functions:
Define functions with def: def greet(name): return f"Hello {name}"
Call functions with arguments: result = greet("Bob")
Functions can return values using return statement.
Default parameters provide fallback values: def power(x, n=2): return x**n

Data structures:
Lists are ordered collections: my_list = [1, 2, 3]
Dictionaries store key-value pairs: person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
Tuples are immutable: coordinates = (10, 20)
Sets contain unique elements: unique = {1, 2, 3}

String operations:
Concatenate strings with +: "Hello" + "World" = "HelloWorld"
Convert to string: str(123) = "123"
Get length: len("Python") = 6
Access characters: "Hello"[0] = "H"

Common programming patterns:
Count items: count = 0; for item in items: count += 1
Filter elements: odds = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 1]
Map operations: squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
Combine lists: combined = list1 + list2

Working with files:
Open file: file = open("data.txt", "r")
Read content: content = file.read()
Write to file: file.write("Hello")
Always close: file.close()
Use with for safety: with open("file.txt") as f: content = f.read()

Error handling:
Try-except blocks catch errors: try: result = 10 / 0 except ZeroDivisionError: print("Error")
Raise exceptions: if x < 0: raise ValueError("Must be positive")
Finally always executes: finally: file.close()

Classes and objects:
Define class: class Dog: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name
Create instance: my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
Access attributes: print(my_dog.name)
Methods are functions in classes: def bark(self): return "Woof!"

Modules and imports:
Import module: import math
Use functions: result = math.sqrt(16)
From imports: from math import sqrt
Alias imports: import numpy as np

Algorithm fundamentals:
Linear search checks each item: for item in list: if item == target: return True
Binary search divides in half: if target < middle: search left, else: search right
Bubble sort compares adjacent: for i in range(n): for j in range(n-i-1): if list[j] > list[j+1]: swap
Selection sort finds minimum: for i in range(n): min_idx = find_min(starting at i)

Search algorithms:
Depth-first explores deeply: use stack data structure with recursion
Breadth-first explores widely: use queue data structure iteratively
Both can traverse tree or graph structures efficiently

Sort algorithms:
Quick sort picks pivot and partitions: divide and conquer approach
Merge sort splits and combines: stable and efficient O(n log n)
Heap sort uses binary heap: in-place sorting algorithm

Data structures implementation:
Stack uses LIFO: last in, first out principle
Queue uses FIFO: first in, first out principle
Linked list connects nodes: each node points to next
Tree has parent-child: hierarchical structure
Graph has nodes and edges: represents relationships

Computational complexity:
Big O notation describes efficiency: O(1) constant, O(n) linear, O(n²) quadratic
Space complexity measures memory: how much memory algorithm uses
Choose algorithms based on problem size and constraints

Recursion patterns:
Base case stops recursion: if n <= 1: return 1
Recursive case calls itself: return n * factorial(n-1)
Stack overflow risks: ensure base case is reached
Memoization optimizes: cache results to avoid recomputation

Dynamic programming:
Break problems into subproblems: identify overlapping structures
Use memoization or tabulation: store solutions to subproblems
Solve in optimal order: build from smallest to largest

Object-oriented design:
Encapsulation bundles data and methods: group related functionality
Inheritance allows code reuse: child classes extend parent classes
Polymorphism enables flexibility: same interface, different implementations
Abstraction hides complexity: expose only necessary details

Design patterns:
Singleton ensures one instance: class has only one object
Factory creates objects: method creates appropriate type
Observer updates dependents: notify multiple listeners of changes
Decorator adds functionality: wrap object with additional features

Test and debug:
Write unit tests: test individual functions in isolation
Use debugger: set breakpoints and step through code
Print statements: temporarily add print() to trace execution
Read error messages carefully: they point to problem locations

Performance tips:
Use generators for large datasets: yield instead of return
Profile code to find bottlenecks: measure execution time
Optimize hot paths: focus on frequently called code
Cache results when possible: avoid repeating expensive computations

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. 1 High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e. g. Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e. Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e. Waymo); generative and creative tools (e. language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e. chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore. "23 Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. a To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. b AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. 4 Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta,5 aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,6 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,78 followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. 910 Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. 11 This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. 12 In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. a Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. 13 By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics. 14 Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. 15 Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. 16 Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering17 allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,18 scene interpretation,19 clinical decision support,20 knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large databases),21 and other areas. 22 A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. 23 Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;24 situations, events, states, and time;25 causes and effects;26 knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);27 default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);28 and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);29 and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally). 16 There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. c Planning and decision-making An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. d32 In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. 33 In automated decision-making, the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. 34 In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. 35 In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. 36 In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e. with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. 37 Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. 38 The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned. 39 Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. 40 Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. 41 It has been a part of AI from the beginning. e In supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. 44 Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). 45 In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good". 46 Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. 47 Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. 48 Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization. 49 Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. 50 Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering. 51 Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguationf unless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" (due to the common sense knowledge problem29). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),52 transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),53 and others. 54 In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text,5556 and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. 57 Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. 58 The field includes speech recognition,59 image classification,60 facial recognition, object recognition,61 object tracking,62 and robotic perception. 63 Social intelligence Kismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. 64 Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. 65 For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. 66 Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. 67 General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. 68 Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. b Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. 69 There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. 70 For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. 71 Simple exhaustive searches72 are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. 15 "Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. 73 Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. 74 Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. 75 Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,76 through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. 77 Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails). 78 Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. 79 Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as "and", "or", "not" and "implies")80 and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as "Every X is a Y" and "There are some Xs that are Ys"). 81 Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises). 82 Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. 83 In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. 84 Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. 85 Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. 86 Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. 28 Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. 87 Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,88 and information value theory. 89 These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,90 dynamic decision networks,91 game theory and mechanism design. 92 Bayesian networks93 are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),g95 learning (using the expectationmaximization algorithm),h97 planning (using decision networks)98 and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks). 91 Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e. hidden Markov models or Kalman filters). 91 Expectationmaximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e. "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e. "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand. Classifiers99 are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an "observation") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. 45 There are many kinds of classifiers in use. 100 The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. 101 K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. 102 The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the "most widely used learner"103 at Google, due in part to its scalability. 104 Neural networks are also used as classifiers. 105 Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain. An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. 105 Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. 106 Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. 107 In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. 108 The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. 109 In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. 110 Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem. 111 Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. 112 Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. 113 Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. 110 The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. 114 Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,115 and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. 116 The sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)i but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet. j GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "hallucinations". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. 124 Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. 125126 Current models and services include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Meta AI. 127 Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text. 128 Hardware and software Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. 129 Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,130 but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant. 131 The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 monthsa trend known as Moore's law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster,132 a trend sometimes called Huang's law,133 named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Applications Main article: Applications of artificial intelligenceAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's FaceID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's Photos and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO). Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. 134 Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. 135136 For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. 137 It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. 137138 New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. 139 In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. 140 In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. 141142 Games Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. 143 Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. 144 In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. 145 In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. 146 Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. 147 DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. 148 In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. 149 In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. 150 In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. 151 Mathematics Large language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning152 or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. 153 A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. 154 One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. 155 The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84 accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems. 156 In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53 of the AIME 2024 and 90 of the MATH benchmark problems. 157 Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry, AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve158 all from Google DeepMind,159 Llemma from EleutherAI160 or Julius. 161 When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. The experimental model Gemini Deep Think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the International Math Olympiad of 2025. 162 Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics. 163 Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated "robot advisers" have been in use for some years. 164 According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions  Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that "the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of e. sophisticated pension innovation. "165 Military Main article: Military applications of artificial intelligence Various countries are deploying AI military applications. 166 The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. 167 Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. 166 AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous. 167 AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. 166168169170 Generative AI Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI softwareThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence. edit Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI,171 or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms of data. 172173 These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data174175 based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts. 176177 Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora. 178179180 Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Microsoft, Google, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, Baidu181 and Yandex. 182 Generative AI is used across many industries, including software development,183 healthcare,184 finance,185 entertainment,186 customer service,187 sales and marketing,188 art, writing,189 fashion,190 and product design. 191 The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling. 192 Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. 193194195 Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries196 and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. 197 For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. 198 Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google IO event on 20 May 2025. 199 It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2. 5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. 200 Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions,201 AI-integrated sex toys (e. teledildonics),202 AI-generated sexual education content,203 and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e. Replika). 204 AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. 205 AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. 206207 Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes. 208 A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. 209210211 In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights. " For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections, US50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. 212 Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv213214 AI has potential benefits and potential risks. 215 AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else". 216 However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. 217218 In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. 219 Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. 220 For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. 221 Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy. 222 AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. 223 Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'. "224 Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "fair use". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work". 225226 Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a "robots. txt" file. 227 In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. 228229 Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors. 230 Dominance by tech giants The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. Amazon, Apple Inc. Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. 231232233 Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace. 234235 Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use. 236 This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. 237 Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e. Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources  from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that  in the long view  AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. 238 A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found "US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation. " and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8 of US power, as opposed to 3 in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. 239 Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. 240 In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US650 million. 241 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. 242 In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100 of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power  enough for 800,000 homes  of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US1. 6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. 243 The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation. 244 After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. 245 Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. 245 On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban. 245 Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. 246 Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. 246 On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. 247 According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. 247 In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1. 5 of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5 of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it. 248 Misinformation See also: Content moderation YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. 249 This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. 250 The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U. S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem. 251 In the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,252 while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s. 253254255 It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;256 one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda. 257 AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling "authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks. 258 AI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using "personhood credentials" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models. 259 Algorithmic bias and fairness Main articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning) Machine learning applications can be biasedk if they learn from biased data. 261 The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. 262 Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output. 263 Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. 264261 If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination. 265 The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On 28 June 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,266 a problem called "sample size disparity". 267 Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. 268 COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61, the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. 269 In 2017, several researchersl showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. 271 A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as "race" or "gender"). The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender". 272 Moritz Hardt said "the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work. "273 Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist. 274 Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive. m Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4 are black and 20 are women. 267 There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws. 260 At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed. dubious  discuss276 Lack of transparency See also: Explainable AI, Algorithmic transparency, and Right to explanation Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. 277 Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are many non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist. 278 It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. 279 Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. 280 People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. 281 Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. n Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used. 282 DARPA established the XAI ("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems. 283 Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. 284 LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. 285 Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. 286 Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. 287 For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts. 288 Bad actors and weaponized AI Main articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. o Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. 290 Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. 290 In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. 291 By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. 292 AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. 293 All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierAI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China. 294295 There are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. 296 Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. 297 In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI. 298 A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. 299 Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47 of U. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9 of U. jobs as "high risk". p301 The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. 297 In April 2023, it was reported that 70 of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. 302303 Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously". 304 Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. 305 In July 2025, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that "artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U. "306 From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. 307 Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, "spell the end of the human race". 308 This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character. q These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips). 310 Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead. "311 In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side". 312 Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. 313 Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly "good at persuasion" and getting better all the time. He asks "Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion. "314 The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. 315 Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,316 as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of AI" without "considering how this impacts Google". 317 He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,318 and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. 319 In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war". 320 Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95 of all cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier. "321 While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, "they can also be used against the bad actors. "322323 Andrew Ng also argued that "it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AIand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests. "324 Yann LeCun "scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction. "325 In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. 326 However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research. 327 Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics, AI safety, Friendly artificial intelligence, Artificial moral agents, and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. 328 Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. 329 The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,329 and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. 330 Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents"331 and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. 332 Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,333 Google,334 EleutherAI and Meta. 335 Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,336337 meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the "weights") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. 338 Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. 339 Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:340341 Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;342 however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. 343 Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. 344 The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. 345 Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. 346 The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. 347 According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. 348349 Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. 350 Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U. and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. 350 The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. 350 Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. 351 In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. 352 In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. 353 On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. 354 In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. 355 In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78 of Chinese citizens, but only 35 of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks". 348 A 2023 ReutersIpsos poll found that 61 of Americans agree, and 22 disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. 356 In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35 of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41 thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13 responding "not very important" and 8 responding "not at all important". 357358 In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 359 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. 360361 In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. 362363 History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence. In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. 364 Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35 more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. 364 The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. 365366 This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain". r They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,368 such as McCulloch and Pitts design for "artificial neurons" in 1943,117 and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible. 369366 The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. s6 The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. t They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":u computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. v7 Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. 366 Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. 373 In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". 374 In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that "within a generation. the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved". 375 They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. w In 1974, both the U. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill377 and ongoing pressure from the U. Congress to fund more productive projects. 378 Minsky and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. 379 The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. 9 In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,380 a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. 8 However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. 10 Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,381 and began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches. 382 Rodney Brooks rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. x Judea Pearl, Lotfi Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. 87387 But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. 388 In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. 389 AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). 390 By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence" (a tendency known as the AI effect). 391 However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. 68 Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. 11 For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. y Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,393 graphics processing units, cloud computing394) and access to large amounts of data395 (including curated datasets,394 such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. z The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50 in the years 20152019. 350 The number of Google searches for the term "AI" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. 327 In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. 396 ChatGPT, launched on 30 November 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. 397 It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. 398 These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the U. alone and about 20 of the new U. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI". 399 About 800,000 "AI"-related U. job openings existed in 2022. 400 According to PitchBook research, 22 of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. 401 Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. 402 Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. 403 Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will. 404 Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI. 403 Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence, Intelligent agent, Artificial mind, Virtual intelligence, and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"405 He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour". 405 He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. 369 Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks. "406 The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. 407 Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. 1 However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. "Aeronautical engineering texts", they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. '"408 AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence". 409 McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world". 410 Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as "the ability to solve hard problems". 411 The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. 1 These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google,412 a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself413 including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. 414 Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,415 with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did "not actually use AI in a material way". 416 There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text. 417 Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. aa The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or "GOFAI")419 simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action. "420 However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult. 421 Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. 422 Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. ab16 The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,424425 in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies "Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,426 but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. 15 Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. 427428 General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that "the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on. "429 However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction. Consciousness Main articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness. 430 The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like. 431 Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam. 432 Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as "strong AI": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds. "ac Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. 436 AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. 437 But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. 438439 Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. 438 Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. 440 In 2017, the European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. 441 Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. 442443 Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. 439438 Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. 428 If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an "intelligence explosion" and Vernor Vinge called a "singularity". 444 However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. 445 Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger. 446 Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence. 447 In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word "robot" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R. U. R. the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,448 and have been a persistent theme in science fiction. 449 A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. 450 Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the "Multivac" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;451 while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. 452 Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek's R. the films A. I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence. 453 See also Artificial consciousness  Field in cognitive science Artificial intelligence and elections  Use and impact of AI on political elections Artificial intelligence content detection  Software to detect AI-generated content Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Behavior selection algorithm  Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents Business process automation  Automation of business processes Case-based reasoning  Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems Computational intelligence  Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation Digital immortality  Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form Emergent algorithm  Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior Female gendering of AI technologies  Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Glossary of artificial intelligence  List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence Intelligence amplification  Use of information technology to augment human intelligence Intelligent agent  Software agent which acts autonomously Intelligent automation  Software process that combines robotic process automation and artificial intelligence List of artificial intelligence books List of artificial intelligence journals List of artificial intelligence projects Mind uploading  Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain Organoid intelligence  Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing Robotic process automation  Form of business process automation technology The Last Day  1967 Welsh science fiction novel Wetware computer  Computer composed of organic material DARWIN EU - A European Union initiative coordinated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to generate and utilize real-world evidence (RWE) to support the evaluation and supervision of medicines across the EU.

It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program. Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". 42 In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: "An Inductive Inference Machine". 43  See AI winter  Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966  Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve. 94  Expectationmaximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables. 96  Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943)117 Alan Turing (1948);118 Karl Steinbuch and Roger David Joseph (1961). 119 Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt(1957);118 Oliver Selfridge (1959);119 Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965);120 Kaoru Nakano (1971);121 Shun-Ichi Amari (1972);121 John Joseph Hopfield (1982). 121 Precursors to backpropagation were developed by: Henry J. Kelley (1960);118 Arthur E. Bryson (1962);118 Stuart Dreyfus (1962);118 Arthur E. Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho (1969);118 Backpropagation was independently developed by: Seppo Linnainmaa (1970);122 Paul Werbos (1974). 118  Geoffrey Hinton said, of his work on neural networks in the 1990s, "our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. And our computers were millions of times too slow. "123  In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense. 260  Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Cynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford)270  Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that machine learning "is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world. "275  When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision. This is the United Nations' definition, and includes things like land mines as well. 289  See table 4; 9 is both the OECD average and the U. average. 300  Sometimes called a "robopocalypse"309  "Electronic brain" was the term used by the press around this time. 365367  Daniel Crevier wrote, "the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science. "370 Russell and Norvig called the conference "the inception of artificial intelligence. "117  Russell and Norvig wrote "for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students. "371  Russell and Norvig wrote, "it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish". 372  The programs described are Arthur Samuel's checkers program for the IBM 701, Daniel Bobrow's STUDENT, Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd's SHRDLU. Russell and Norvig write: "in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems"376  Embodied approaches to AI383 were championed by Hans Moravec384 and Rodney Brooks385 and went by many names: Nouvelle AI. 385 Developmental robotics. 386  Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic: "Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called "deep learning". As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another. "392  Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg: "After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015. 394  Nils Nilsson wrote in 1983: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about. "418  Daniel Crevier wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier. "423  Searle presented this definition of "Strong AI" in 1999. 433 Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states. "434 Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig: "Stong AI  the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking).

Frank, Michael (22 September 2023). "US Leadership in Artificial Intelligence Can Shape the 21st Century Global Order". The Diplomat. Instead, the United States has developed a new area of dominance that the rest of the world views with a mixture of awe, envy, and resentment: artificial intelligence. From AI models and research to cloud computing and venture capital, U. companies, universities, and research labs  and their affiliates in allied countries  appear to have an enormous lead in both developing cutting-edge AI and commercializing it. The value of U. venture capital investments in AI start-ups exceeds that of the rest of the world combined. Gertner, Jon.

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics. Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. 45 From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework. Historyedit See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. 67 The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. 89 The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. 10 In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. 11 Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. 10 Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. 10 By the early 1960s, an experimental "learning machine" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively "trained" by a human operatorteacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a "goof" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. 12 A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nils Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. 13 Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. 14 In 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. 15 Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. "16 This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which the question, "Can machines think?", is replaced with the question, "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?". 17 Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. 18 Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods. In 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis. 19 By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques. 20 Shortly after, transformer architectures obtained natural language processing, powering the now popular large language models advancing generative AI and multimodal applications. 21 Relationships to other fieldsedit Artificial intelligenceedit Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. 22 As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "neural networks"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics. 23 Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis. 24: 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. 24: 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. 25 Work on symbolicknowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval. 24: 708710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AICS field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation. 24: 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence, to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory. 25 Data compressionedit This section is an excerpt from Data compression  Machine learning. edit There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for "general intelligence". 262728 An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(. ) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(. ) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm x. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. 29 According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audiovideo compression software include NVIDIA Maxine, AIVC. 30 Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. 31 In unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression. 32 Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. 33 Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43. 4 and 16. 4 of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. 3435 Data miningedit Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "unsupervised learning" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. citation needed Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation: Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). 36 Generalizationedit Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statisticsedit Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. 37 Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. 38 Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,39 wherein "algorithmic model" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. 40 Statistical physicsedit Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e. g. to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks. 41 Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics. 42 Theoryedit Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. 343 Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error. For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. 44 In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approachesedit In supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. 3 Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems. 454647 Supervised learningedit Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary. Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. 48 The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimisation of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. 49 An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. 16 Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression. 50 Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. 51 Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learningedit Main article: Unsupervised learningSee also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction,5 and density estimation. 52 Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. 5354 Semi-supervised learningedit Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. 55 Reinforcement learningedit Main article: Reinforcement learning In reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment: these produce a reward andor a representation of the state, which is fed back to the agent. Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimisation, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. 56 Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reductionedit Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. 57 In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the "number of features". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e. 3D) to a smaller space (e. 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation. Other typesedit Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modelling, meta-learning. 58 Self-learningedit Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA). 5960 It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. 61 The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W w(a,s) such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s)  w(a,s)  v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. 62 Feature learningedit Main article: Feature learning Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. 63 Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorisation64 and various forms of clustering. 656667 Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. 68 Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. 69 Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learningedit Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. 70 A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. 71 Anomaly detectionedit Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. 72 Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. 73 In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. 74 Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. 75 Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learningedit Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,7677 and finally meta-learning (e. MAML). Association rulesedit Main article: Association rule learningSee also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of "interestingness". 78 Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves "rules" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. 79 Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. 80 For example, the rule  o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s    b u r g e r  displaystyle mathrm onions,potatoes Rightarrow mathrm burger  found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. 81 Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. 828384 Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. 85 The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. Modelsedit A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, once "trained" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions. 86 By extension, the term "model" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned. 87 Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection. Artificial neural networksedit Main article: Artificial neural networkSee also: Deep learning An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "artificial neurons", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a "signal", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called "edges". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition. 88 Decision treesedit Main article: Decision tree learning A decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the Titanic Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Random forest regressionedit Random forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decision tree-based models. RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor tasks. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various applications. 8990 Support-vector machinesedit Main article: Support-vector machine Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category. 91 An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Regression analysisedit Main article: Regression analysis Illustration of linear regression on a data set Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularisation methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel92), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. Multivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,93 which are inherently multi-dimensional. Bayesian networksedit Main article: Bayesian network A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams. Gaussian processesedit Main article: Gaussian processes An example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models94 A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or inputoutput examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimisation used to do hyperparameter optimisation. Genetic algorithmsedit Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. 9596 Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms. 97 Belief functionsedit Main article: DempsterShafer theory The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or DempsterShafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e. Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities. 98 However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving. 997 However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches. Rule-based modelsedit Main article: Rule-based machine learning Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns 'rules' from data. It provides interpretable models, making it useful for decision-making in fields like healthcare, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Key RBML techniques includes learning classifier systems,100 association rule learning,101 artificial immune systems,102 and other similar models. These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time. Training modelsedit Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learningedit Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google. 103 Applicationsedit There are many applications for machine learning, including: Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decision-making Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brainmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial data analysis104 General game playing Handwriting recognition Healthcare Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Investment management 105 Knowledge graph embedding Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Material Engineering Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimisation Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunications Theorem proving Time-series forecasting Tomographic reconstruction106 User behaviour analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first "Netflix Prize" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10. A joint team made up of researchers from ATT Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for 1 million. 107 Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns ("everything is a recommendation") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. 108 In 2010, an article in The Wall Street Journal noted the use of machine learning by Rebellion Research to predict the 2008 financial crisis. 109 In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. 110 In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists. 111 In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning. 112 In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19. 113 Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers. 114 Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone. 115116117 When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS. 118 Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes. 119 Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes. 120121122 Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires. 123124 Limitationsedit Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. 125126127 Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems. 128 The "black box theory" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data. 129 The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an "intelligence system" that could have a "substantial impact on an individual's life" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided "a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions" it makes. 129 In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision. 130 Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested. 131132 Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users. 133 Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves. 134 Explainabilityedit Main article: Explainable artificial intelligence Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. 135 It contrasts with the "black box" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. 136 By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Overfittingedit Main article: Overfitting The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is. 137 Other limitations and vulnerabilitiesedit Learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. 138 A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images that the system misclassifies. 139140 Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel. 141 Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning. 142 Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e. for categories "spam" and well-visible "not spam" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access. 143144145 Model assessmentsedit Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy. 146 In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model. 147 Ethicsedit This section is an excerpt from Ethics of artificial intelligence. edit The ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. 148 This includes algorithmic biases, fairness,149 automated decision-making,150 accountability, privacy, and regulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation,151 how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. 148 Some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military. Biasedit Main article: Algorithmic bias Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society. 152 Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices. 153 For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names. 152 Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. 154155 Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in "disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities" after being trained with historical crime data. 156 While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases. 157 In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, "female faculty merely make up 16. 1" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world. 158 Furthermore, among the group of "new U. S. resident AI PhD graduates," 45 identified as white, 22. 4 as Asian, 3. 2 as Hispanic, and 2. 4 as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI. 158 Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. 159160 Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases. 161162 In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language. 163 In an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged "black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants". 156 In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas. 164 Similar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems. 165 Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains. 166 Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who said that "there's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, andmost importantlyit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility. "167 Financial incentivesedit There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated. 168 Hardwareedit Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units. 169 By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. 170 OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3. 4 months. 171172 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)edit Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialised hardware accelerators developed by Google specifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purpose GPUs and FPGAs, TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency. 173 Since their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments. Neuromorphic computingedit Neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures. 174 Physical neural networksedit A physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function of neural synapses. The term "physical neural network" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses. 175176 Embedded machine learningedit Embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources, such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers. 177178179180 Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such as hardware acceleration,181182 approximate computing,183 and model optimisation. 184185 Common optimisation techniques include pruning, quantisation, knowledge distillation, low-rank factorisation, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.

Neural network - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Structure in biology and artificial intelligence For other uses, see Neural network (disambiguation). A neural network is a group of interconnected units called neurons that send signals to one another. Neurons can be either biological cells or signal pathways. While individual neurons are simple, many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks. There are two main types of neural networks. In neuroscience, a biological neural network is a physical structure found in brains and complex nervous systems  a population of nerve cells connected by synapses. In machine learning, an artificial neural network is a mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions. Artificial neural networks are used to solve artificial intelligence problems. In biologyedit Animated confocal micrograph of part of a biological neural network in a mouse's striatum Main article: Neural network (biology) In the context of biology, a neural network is a population of biological neurons chemically connected to each other by synapses. A given neuron can be connected to hundreds of thousands of synapses. 1 Each neuron sends and receives electrochemical signals called action potentials to its connected neighbors. A neuron can serve an excitatory role, amplifying and propagating signals it receives, or an inhibitory role, suppressing signals instead. 1 Populations of interconnected neurons that are smaller than neural networks are called neural circuits. Very large interconnected networks are called large scale brain networks, and many of these together form brains and nervous systems. Signals generated by neural networks in the brain eventually travel through the nervous system and across neuromuscular junctions to muscle cells, where they cause contraction and thereby motion. 2 In machine learningedit Main article: Neural network (machine learning) Schematic of a simple feedforward artificial neural network In machine learning, a neural network is an artificial mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions. While early artificial neural networks were physical machines,3 today they are almost always implemented in software. Neurons in an artificial neural network are usually arranged into layers, with information passing from the first layer (the input layer) through one or more intermediate layers (the hidden layers) to the final layer (the output layer). 4 The "signal" input to each neuron is a number, specifically a linear combination of the outputs of the connected neurons in the previous layer. The signal each neuron outputs is calculated from this number, according to its activation function. The behavior of the network depends on the strengths (or weights) of the connections between neurons. A network is trained by modifying these weights through empirical risk minimization or backpropagation in order to fit some preexisting dataset. 5 The term deep neural network refers to neural networks that have more than three layers, typically including at least two hidden layers in addition to the input and output layers. Neural networks are used to solve problems in artificial intelligence, and have thereby found applications in many disciplines, including predictive modeling, adaptive control, facial recognition, handwriting recognition, general game playing, and generative AI. Historyedit See also: Biological neural network  History, and History of artificial neural networks The theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by Alexander Bain in 18736 and William James in 1890. 7 Both posited that human thought emerged from interactions among large numbers of neurons inside the brain. In 1949, Donald Hebb described Hebbian learning, the idea that neural networks can change and learn over time by strengthening a synapse every time a signal travels along it. 8 In 1956, Svaetichin discovered the functioning of second order retinal cells (Horizontal Cells), which were fundamental for the understanding of neural networks. Artificial neural networks were originally used to model biological neural networks starting in the 1930s under the approach of connectionism. However, starting with the invention of the perceptron, a simple artificial neural network, by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943,9 followed by the implementation of one in hardware by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957,3 artificial neural networks became increasingly used for machine learning applications instead, and increasingly different from their biological counterparts.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. 1 High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e. g. Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e. Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e. Waymo); generative and creative tools (e. language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e. chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore. "23 Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. a To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. b AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. 4 Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta,5 aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,6 and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history,78 followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. 910 Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. 11 This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. 12 In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. a Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. 13 By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics. 14 Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. 15 Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. 16 Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering17 allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,18 scene interpretation,19 clinical decision support,20 knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large databases),21 and other areas. 22 A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. 23 Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;24 situations, events, states, and time;25 causes and effects;26 knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);27 default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);28 and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);29 and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally). 16 There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. c Planning and decision-making An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. d32 In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. 33 In automated decision-making, the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. 34 In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. 35 In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. 36 In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e. with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. 37 Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. 38 The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned. 39 Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. 40 Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. 41 It has been a part of AI from the beginning. e In supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. 44 Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). 45 In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good". 46 Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. 47 Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. 48 Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization. 49 Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. 50 Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering. 51 Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguationf unless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" (due to the common sense knowledge problem29). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),52 transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),53 and others. 54 In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text,5556 and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. 57 Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. 58 The field includes speech recognition,59 image classification,60 facial recognition, object recognition,61 object tracking,62 and robotic perception. 63 Social intelligence Kismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. 64 Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. 65 For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. 66 Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. 67 General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. 68 Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. b Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. 69 There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. 70 For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. 71 Simple exhaustive searches72 are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. 15 "Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. 73 Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. 74 Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. 75 Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks,76 through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. 77 Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails). 78 Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. 79 Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as "and", "or", "not" and "implies")80 and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as "Every X is a Y" and "There are some Xs that are Ys"). 81 Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises). 82 Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. 83 In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. 84 Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. 85 Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. 86 Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. 28 Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network, with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. 87 Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,88 and information value theory. 89 These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,90 dynamic decision networks,91 game theory and mechanism design. 92 Bayesian networks93 are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),g95 learning (using the expectationmaximization algorithm),h97 planning (using decision networks)98 and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks). 91 Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e. hidden Markov models or Kalman filters). 91 Expectationmaximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e. "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e. "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand. Classifiers99 are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an "observation") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. 45 There are many kinds of classifiers in use. 100 The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. 101 K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. 102 The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the "most widely used learner"103 at Google, due in part to its scalability. 104 Neural networks are also used as classifiers. 105 Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain. An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. 105 Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. 106 Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. 107 In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. 108 The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. 109 In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. 110 Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem. 111 Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. 112 Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. 113 Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. 110 The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. 114 Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,115 and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. 116 The sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)i but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet. j GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "hallucinations". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. 124 Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. 125126 Current models and services include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Meta AI. 127 Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text. 128 Hardware and software Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. 129 Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,130 but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant. 131 The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 monthsa trend known as Moore's law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster,132 a trend sometimes called Huang's law,133 named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang. Applications Main article: Applications of artificial intelligenceAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's FaceID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's Photos and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO). Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. 134 Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. 135136 For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. 137 It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. 137138 New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. 139 In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. 140 In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. 141142 Games Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. 143 Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. 144 In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. 145 In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. 146 Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. 147 DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. 148 In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. 149 In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. 150 In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. 151 Mathematics Large language models, such as GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Llama or Mistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning152 or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. 153 A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. 154 One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. 155 The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84 accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems. 156 In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53 of the AIME 2024 and 90 of the MATH benchmark problems. 157 Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry, AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve158 all from Google DeepMind,159 Llemma from EleutherAI160 or Julius. 161 When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. The experimental model Gemini Deep Think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the International Math Olympiad of 2025. 162 Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics. 163 Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated "robot advisers" have been in use for some years. 164 According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions  Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that "the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of e. sophisticated pension innovation. "165 Military Main article: Military applications of artificial intelligence Various countries are deploying AI military applications. 166 The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. 167 Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. 166 AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous. 167 AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. 166168169170 Generative AI Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI softwareThese paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence. edit Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI,171 or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms of data. 172173 These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data174175 based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts. 176177 Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer-based deep neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora. 178179180 Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Meta AI, Microsoft, Google, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, Baidu181 and Yandex. 182 Generative AI is used across many industries, including software development,183 healthcare,184 finance,185 entertainment,186 customer service,187 sales and marketing,188 art, writing,189 fashion,190 and product design. 191 The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling. 192 Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. 193194195 Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries196 and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. 197 For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. 198 Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google IO event on 20 May 2025. 199 It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2. 5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. 200 Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions,201 AI-integrated sex toys (e. teledildonics),202 AI-generated sexual education content,203 and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e. Replika). 204 AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. 205 AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. 206207 Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes. 208 A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. 209210211 In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights. " For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections, US50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. 212 Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv213214 AI has potential benefits and potential risks. 215 AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else". 216 However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. 217218 In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. 219 Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. 220 For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. 221 Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy. 222 AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. 223 Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'. "224 Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "fair use". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work". 225226 Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a "robots. txt" file. 227 In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. 228229 Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors. 230 Dominance by tech giants The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. Amazon, Apple Inc. Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. 231232233 Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace. 234235 Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use. 236 This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. 237 Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e. Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources  from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that  in the long view  AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. 238 A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found "US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation. " and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8 of US power, as opposed to 3 in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. 239 Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. 240 In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US650 million. 241 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. 242 In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100 of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power  enough for 800,000 homes  of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US1. 6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. 243 The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation. 244 After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. 245 Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. 245 On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban. 245 Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. 246 Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. 246 On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. 247 According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. 247 In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1. 5 of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5 of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it. 248 Misinformation See also: Content moderation YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. 249 This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. 250 The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U. S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem. 251 In the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,252 while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s. 253254255 It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;256 one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda. 257 AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling "authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks. 258 AI researchers at Microsoft, OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using "personhood credentials" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models. 259 Algorithmic bias and fairness Main articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning) Machine learning applications can be biasedk if they learn from biased data. 261 The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. 262 Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output. 263 Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. 264261 If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination. 265 The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On 28 June 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,266 a problem called "sample size disparity". 267 Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. 268 COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61, the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. 269 In 2017, several researchersl showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. 271 A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as "race" or "gender"). The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender". 272 Moritz Hardt said "the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work. "273 Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist. 274 Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive. m Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4 are black and 20 are women. 267 There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws. 260 At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed. dubious  discuss276 Lack of transparency See also: Explainable AI, Algorithmic transparency, and Right to explanation Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. 277 Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are many non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist. 278 It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. 279 Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. 280 People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. 281 Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. n Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used. 282 DARPA established the XAI ("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems. 283 Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. 284 LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. 285 Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. 286 Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. 287 For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts. 288 Bad actors and weaponized AI Main articles: Lethal autonomous weapon, Artificial intelligence arms race, and AI safety Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. o Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. 290 Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. 290 In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. 291 By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. 292 AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. 293 All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierAI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China. 294295 There are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. 296 Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. 297 In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI. 298 A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. 299 Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47 of U. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9 of U. jobs as "high risk". p301 The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. 297 In April 2023, it was reported that 70 of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. 302303 Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously". 304 Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. 305 In July 2025, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that "artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U. "306 From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. 307 Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, "spell the end of the human race". 308 This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character. q These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips). 310 Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead. "311 In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side". 312 Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are built on language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. 313 Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly "good at persuasion" and getting better all the time. He asks "Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion. "314 The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. 315 Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,316 as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of AI" without "considering how this impacts Google". 317 He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,318 and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. 319 In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war". 320 Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95 of all cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier. "321 While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, "they can also be used against the bad actors. "322323 Andrew Ng also argued that "it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AIand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests. "324 Yann LeCun "scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction. "325 In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. 326 However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research. 327 Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics, AI safety, Friendly artificial intelligence, Artificial moral agents, and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. 328 Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. 329 The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,329 and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. 330 Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents"331 and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. 332 Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,333 Google,334 EleutherAI and Meta. 335 Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,336337 meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the "weights") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. 338 Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. 339 Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:340341 Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;342 however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. 343 Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. 344 The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. 345 Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence, Regulation of algorithms, and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. 346 The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. 347 According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. 348349 Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. 350 Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U. and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. 350 The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. 350 Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. 351 In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. 352 In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. 353 On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. 354 In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. 355 In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78 of Chinese citizens, but only 35 of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks". 348 A 2023 ReutersIpsos poll found that 61 of Americans agree, and 22 disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. 356 In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35 of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41 thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13 responding "not very important" and 8 responding "not at all important". 357358 In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 359 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. 360361 In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. 362363 History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence. In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. 364 Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35 more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. 364 The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. 365366 This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain". r They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,368 such as McCulloch and Pitts design for "artificial neurons" in 1943,117 and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible. 369366 The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. s6 The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. t They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":u computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. v7 Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. 366 Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. 373 In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". 374 In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that "within a generation. the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved". 375 They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. w In 1974, both the U. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill377 and ongoing pressure from the U. Congress to fund more productive projects. 378 Minsky and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. 379 The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. 9 In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,380 a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. 8 However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. 10 Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,381 and began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches. 382 Rodney Brooks rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. x Judea Pearl, Lotfi Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. 87387 But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. 388 In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. 389 AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). 390 By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence" (a tendency known as the AI effect). 391 However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. 68 Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. 11 For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. y Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,393 graphics processing units, cloud computing394) and access to large amounts of data395 (including curated datasets,394 such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. z The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50 in the years 20152019. 350 The number of Google searches for the term "AI" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. 327 In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. 396 ChatGPT, launched on 30 November 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. 397 It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. 398 These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the U. alone and about 20 of the new U. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI". 399 About 800,000 "AI"-related U. job openings existed in 2022. 400 According to PitchBook research, 22 of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. 401 Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. 402 Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. 403 Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will. 404 Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI. 403 Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence, Intelligent agent, Artificial mind, Virtual intelligence, and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"405 He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour". 405 He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. 369 Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks. "406 The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. 407 Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. 1 However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. "Aeronautical engineering texts", they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. '"408 AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence". 409 McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world". 410 Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as "the ability to solve hard problems". 411 The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. 1 These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google,412 a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself413 including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. 414 Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,415 with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did "not actually use AI in a material way". 416 There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text. 417 Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. aa The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or "GOFAI")419 simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action. "420 However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult. 421 Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. 422 Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. ab16 The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,424425 in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies "Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,426 but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. 15 Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. 427428 General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that "the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on. "429 However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction. Consciousness Main articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness. 430 The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like. 431 Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam. 432 Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as "strong AI": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds. "ac Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. 436 AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. 437 But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. 438439 Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. 438 Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. 440 In 2017, the European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. 441 Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. 442443 Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. 439438 Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. 428 If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an "intelligence explosion" and Vernor Vinge called a "singularity". 444 However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. 445 Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger. 446 Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence. 447 In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word "robot" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R. U. R. the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,448 and have been a persistent theme in science fiction. 449 A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. 450 Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the "Multivac" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;451 while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. 452 Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek's R. the films A. I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence. 453 See also Artificial consciousness  Field in cognitive science Artificial intelligence and elections  Use and impact of AI on political elections Artificial intelligence content detection  Software to detect AI-generated content Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Behavior selection algorithm  Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents Business process automation  Automation of business processes Case-based reasoning  Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems Computational intelligence  Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation Digital immortality  Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form Emergent algorithm  Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior Female gendering of AI technologies  Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets Glossary of artificial intelligence  List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence Intelligence amplification  Use of information technology to augment human intelligence Intelligent agent  Software agent which acts autonomously Intelligent automation  Software process that combines robotic process automation and artificial intelligence List of artificial intelligence books List of artificial intelligence journals List of artificial intelligence projects Mind uploading  Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain Organoid intelligence  Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing Robotic process automation  Form of business process automation technology The Last Day  1967 Welsh science fiction novel Wetware computer  Computer composed of organic material DARWIN EU - A European Union initiative coordinated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to generate and utilize real-world evidence (RWE) to support the evaluation and supervision of medicines across the EU.

It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program. Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". 42 In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: "An Inductive Inference Machine". 43  See AI winter  Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966  Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve. 94  Expectationmaximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables. 96  Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943)117 Alan Turing (1948);118 Karl Steinbuch and Roger David Joseph (1961). 119 Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt(1957);118 Oliver Selfridge (1959);119 Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965);120 Kaoru Nakano (1971);121 Shun-Ichi Amari (1972);121 John Joseph Hopfield (1982). 121 Precursors to backpropagation were developed by: Henry J. Kelley (1960);118 Arthur E. Bryson (1962);118 Stuart Dreyfus (1962);118 Arthur E. Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho (1969);118 Backpropagation was independently developed by: Seppo Linnainmaa (1970);122 Paul Werbos (1974). 118  Geoffrey Hinton said, of his work on neural networks in the 1990s, "our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. And our computers were millions of times too slow. "123  In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense. 260  Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Cynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford)270  Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that machine learning "is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world. "275  When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision. This is the United Nations' definition, and includes things like land mines as well. 289  See table 4; 9 is both the OECD average and the U. average. 300  Sometimes called a "robopocalypse"309  "Electronic brain" was the term used by the press around this time. 365367  Daniel Crevier wrote, "the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science. "370 Russell and Norvig called the conference "the inception of artificial intelligence. "117  Russell and Norvig wrote "for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students. "371  Russell and Norvig wrote, "it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish". 372  The programs described are Arthur Samuel's checkers program for the IBM 701, Daniel Bobrow's STUDENT, Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd's SHRDLU. Russell and Norvig write: "in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems"376  Embodied approaches to AI383 were championed by Hans Moravec384 and Rodney Brooks385 and went by many names: Nouvelle AI. 385 Developmental robotics. 386  Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic: "Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called "deep learning". As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another. "392  Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg: "After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015. 394  Nils Nilsson wrote in 1983: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about. "418  Daniel Crevier wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier. "423  Searle presented this definition of "Strong AI" in 1999. 433 Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states. "434 Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig: "Stong AI  the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking).

Instead, the United States has developed a new area of dominance that the rest of the world views with a mixture of awe, envy, and resentment: artificial intelligence. From AI models and research to cloud computing and venture capital, U. companies, universities, and research labs  and their affiliates in allied countries  appear to have an enormous lead in both developing cutting-edge AI and commercializing it. The value of U. venture capital investments in AI start-ups exceeds that of the rest of the world combined. Gertner, Jon.

The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics. Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning. 45 From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework. Historyedit See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. 67 The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. 89 The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. 10 In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. 11 Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. 10 Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. 10 By the early 1960s, an experimental "learning machine" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively "trained" by a human operatorteacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a "goof" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. 12 A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nils Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. 13 Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. 14 In 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. 15 Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. "16 This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which the question, "Can machines think?", is replaced with the question, "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?". 17 Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. 18 Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods. In 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis. 19 By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques. 20 Shortly after, transformer architectures obtained natural language processing, powering the now popular large language models advancing generative AI and multimodal applications. 21 Relationships to other fieldsedit Artificial intelligenceedit Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. 22 As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "neural networks"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics. 23 Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis. 24: 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. 24: 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. 25 Work on symbolicknowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval. 24: 708710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AICS field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation. 24: 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence, to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory. 25 Data compressionedit This section is an excerpt from Data compression  Machine learning. edit There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for "general intelligence". 262728 An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(. ) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(. ) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm x. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. 29 According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audiovideo compression software include NVIDIA Maxine, AIVC. 30 Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV, TensorFlow, MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. 31 In unsupervised machine learning, k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression. 32 Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. 33 Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43. 4 and 16. 4 of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. 3435 Data miningedit Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "unsupervised learning" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. citation needed Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation: Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). 36 Generalizationedit Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statisticsedit Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. 37 Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. 38 Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,39 wherein "algorithmic model" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. 40 Statistical physicsedit Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e. g. to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks. 41 Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics. 42 Theoryedit Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. 343 Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The biasvariance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error. For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. 44 In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approachesedit In supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system: Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning). Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. 3 Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems. 454647 Supervised learningedit Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary. Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. 48 The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. Through iterative optimisation of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. 49 An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. 16 Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression. 50 Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. 51 Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learningedit Main article: Unsupervised learningSee also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction,5 and density estimation. 52 Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. 5354 Semi-supervised learningedit Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. 55 Reinforcement learningedit Main article: Reinforcement learning In reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment: these produce a reward andor a representation of the state, which is fed back to the agent. Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimisation, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. 56 Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reductionedit Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. 57 In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the "number of features". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e. 3D) to a smaller space (e. 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation. Other typesedit Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modelling, meta-learning. 58 Self-learningedit Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA). 5960 It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. 61 The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W w(a,s) such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s)  w(a,s)  v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. 62 Feature learningedit Main article: Feature learning Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. 63 Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorisation64 and various forms of clustering. 656667 Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. 68 Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. 69 Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learningedit Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. 70 A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. 71 Anomaly detectionedit Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. 72 Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. 73 In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. 74 Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. 75 Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learningedit Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,7677 and finally meta-learning (e. MAML). Association rulesedit Main article: Association rule learningSee also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of "interestingness". 78 Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves "rules" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. 79 Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems. Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. 80 For example, the rule  o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s    b u r g e r  displaystyle mathrm onions,potatoes Rightarrow mathrm burger  found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. 81 Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs. Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. 828384 Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. 85 The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. Modelsedit A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, once "trained" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions. 86 By extension, the term "model" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned. 87 Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection. Artificial neural networksedit Main article: Artificial neural networkSee also: Deep learning An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "artificial neurons", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a "signal", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called "edges". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition. 88 Decision treesedit Main article: Decision tree learning A decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the Titanic Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Random forest regressionedit Random forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decision tree-based models. RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor tasks. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various applications. 8990 Support-vector machinesedit Main article: Support-vector machine Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category. 91 An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Regression analysisedit Main article: Regression analysis Illustration of linear regression on a data set Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularisation methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel92), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. Multivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,93 which are inherently multi-dimensional. Bayesian networksedit Main article: Bayesian network A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams. Gaussian processesedit Main article: Gaussian processes An example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models94 A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or inputoutput examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimisation used to do hyperparameter optimisation. Genetic algorithmsedit Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. 9596 Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms. 97 Belief functionsedit Main article: DempsterShafer theory The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or DempsterShafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e. Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities. 98 However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving. 997 However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches. Rule-based modelsedit Main article: Rule-based machine learning Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns 'rules' from data. It provides interpretable models, making it useful for decision-making in fields like healthcare, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Key RBML techniques includes learning classifier systems,100 association rule learning,101 artificial immune systems,102 and other similar models. These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time. Training modelsedit Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learningedit Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google. 103 Applicationsedit There are many applications for machine learning, including: Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decision-making Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brainmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial data analysis104 General game playing Handwriting recognition Healthcare Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Investment management 105 Knowledge graph embedding Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Material Engineering Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimisation Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunications Theorem proving Time-series forecasting Tomographic reconstruction106 User behaviour analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first "Netflix Prize" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10. A joint team made up of researchers from ATT Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for 1 million. 107 Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns ("everything is a recommendation") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. 108 In 2010, an article in The Wall Street Journal noted the use of machine learning by Rebellion Research to predict the 2008 financial crisis. 109 In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. 110 In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists. 111 In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning. 112 In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19. 113 Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers. 114 Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone. 115116117 When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS. 118 Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes. 119 Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes. 120121122 Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires. 123124 Limitationsedit Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. 125126127 Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems. 128 The "black box theory" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data. 129 The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an "intelligence system" that could have a "substantial impact on an individual's life" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided "a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions" it makes. 129 In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision. 130 Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested. 131132 Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users. 133 Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves. 134 Explainabilityedit Main article: Explainable artificial intelligence Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. 135 It contrasts with the "black box" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. 136 By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Overfittingedit Main article: Overfitting The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is. 137 Other limitations and vulnerabilitiesedit Learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. 138 A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images that the system misclassifies. 139140 Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel. 141 Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning. 142 Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e. for categories "spam" and well-visible "not spam" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of datasoftware transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access. 143144145 Model assessmentsedit Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy. 146 In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model. 147 Ethicsedit This section is an excerpt from Ethics of artificial intelligence. edit The ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. 148 This includes algorithmic biases, fairness,149 automated decision-making,150 accountability, privacy, and regulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems, arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment, technological unemployment, AI-enabled misinformation,151 how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks. 148 Some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare, education, criminal justice, or the military. Biasedit Main article: Algorithmic bias Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society. 152 Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices. 153 For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names. 152 Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. 154155 Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in "disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities" after being trained with historical crime data. 156 While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases. 157 In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, "female faculty merely make up 16. 1" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world. 158 Furthermore, among the group of "new U. S. resident AI PhD graduates," 45 identified as white, 22. 4 as Asian, 3. 2 as Hispanic, and 2. 4 as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI. 158 Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. 159160 Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases. 161162 In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language. 163 In an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged "black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants". 156 In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas. 164 Similar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems. 165 Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains. 166 Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who said that "there's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, andmost importantlyit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility. "167 Financial incentivesedit There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated. 168 Hardwareedit Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units. 169 By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. 170 OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3. 4 months. 171172 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)edit Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialised hardware accelerators developed by Google specifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purpose GPUs and FPGAs, TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency. 173 Since their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments. Neuromorphic computingedit Neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures. 174 Physical neural networksedit A physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function of neural synapses. The term "physical neural network" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses. 175176 Embedded machine learningedit Embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources, such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers. 177178179180 Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such as hardware acceleration,181182 approximate computing,183 and model optimisation. 184185 Common optimisation techniques include pruning, quantisation, knowledge distillation, low-rank factorisation, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.

Neural network - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Structure in biology and artificial intelligence For other uses, see Neural network (disambiguation). A neural network is a group of interconnected units called neurons that send signals to one another. Neurons can be either biological cells or signal pathways. While individual neurons are simple, many of them together in a network can perform complex tasks. There are two main types of neural networks. In neuroscience, a biological neural network is a physical structure found in brains and complex nervous systems  a population of nerve cells connected by synapses. In machine learning, an artificial neural network is a mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions. Artificial neural networks are used to solve artificial intelligence problems. In biologyedit Animated confocal micrograph of part of a biological neural network in a mouse's striatum Main article: Neural network (biology) In the context of biology, a neural network is a population of biological neurons chemically connected to each other by synapses. A given neuron can be connected to hundreds of thousands of synapses. 1 Each neuron sends and receives electrochemical signals called action potentials to its connected neighbors. A neuron can serve an excitatory role, amplifying and propagating signals it receives, or an inhibitory role, suppressing signals instead. 1 Populations of interconnected neurons that are smaller than neural networks are called neural circuits. Very large interconnected networks are called large scale brain networks, and many of these together form brains and nervous systems. Signals generated by neural networks in the brain eventually travel through the nervous system and across neuromuscular junctions to muscle cells, where they cause contraction and thereby motion. 2 In machine learningedit Main article: Neural network (machine learning) Schematic of a simple feedforward artificial neural network In machine learning, a neural network is an artificial mathematical model used to approximate nonlinear functions. While early artificial neural networks were physical machines,3 today they are almost always implemented in software. Neurons in an artificial neural network are usually arranged into layers, with information passing from the first layer (the input layer) through one or more intermediate layers (the hidden layers) to the final layer (the output layer). 4 The "signal" input to each neuron is a number, specifically a linear combination of the outputs of the connected neurons in the previous layer. The signal each neuron outputs is calculated from this number, according to its activation function. The behavior of the network depends on the strengths (or weights) of the connections between neurons. A network is trained by modifying these weights through empirical risk minimization or backpropagation in order to fit some preexisting dataset. 5 The term deep neural network refers to neural networks that have more than three layers, typically including at least two hidden layers in addition to the input and output layers. Neural networks are used to solve problems in artificial intelligence, and have thereby found applications in many disciplines, including predictive modeling, adaptive control, facial recognition, handwriting recognition, general game playing, and generative AI. Historyedit See also: Biological neural network  History, and History of artificial neural networks The theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by Alexander Bain in 18736 and William James in 1890. 7 Both posited that human thought emerged from interactions among large numbers of neurons inside the brain. In 1949, Donald Hebb described Hebbian learning, the idea that neural networks can change and learn over time by strengthening a synapse every time a signal travels along it. 8 In 1956, Svaetichin discovered the functioning of second order retinal cells (Horizontal Cells), which were fundamental for the understanding of neural networks. Artificial neural networks were originally used to model biological neural networks starting in the 1930s under the approach of connectionism. However, starting with the invention of the perceptron, a simple artificial neural network, by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943,9 followed by the implementation of one in hardware by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957,3 artificial neural networks became increasingly used for machine learning applications instead, and increasingly different from their biological counterparts.
